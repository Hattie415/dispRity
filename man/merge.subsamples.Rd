\title{Combines or cleans subsamples.}
\usage{
\method{merge}{subsamples}(data, subsamples)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{dispRity} object.}

\item{subsamples}{Either a \code{vector} of the number or name of the subsamples to merge or a single \code{numeric} value of the minimum of elements for each series (see details).}
}
\value{
A \code{dispRity} object containing the original matrix and subsamples.
NOTE: if the data are already bootstrapped/rarefied or/and disparity already calculated the operation will have to be performed again.
}
\description{
Combines multiple subsamples together or cleans a subsample series to contain at least n elements.
}
\details{
If \code{subsample} is a vector, the subsamples are merged in the given input order. \code{c(1, 3, 4)} will merge subsamples 1 and 3 into 4, while the opposite, \code{c(3, 4, 1)} will merge subsamples 3 and 4 into 1.
When a single numeric value is given, subsamples are merged with the next subsample until the correct number of elements for each subsample is reached (apart from the last subsample that gets merged with the previous one).
}
\examples{
## Generate subsamples from a dummy matrix
dummy_matrix <- matrix(rnorm(120), 40)
dummy_subsamples <- custom.subsamples(dummy_matrix,
     group = list("a" = c(1:5), "b" = c(6:10), "c" = c(11:20),
                  "d" = c(21:24), "e" = c(25:30), "f" = c(31:40)))

## Merging the two first subsamples
merge.subsamples(dummy_subsamples, c(1,2))

## Merging the three subsamples by name
merge.subsamples(dummy_subsamples, c("d", "c", "e"))

## Merging the subsamples to contain at least 20 taxa
merge.subsamples(dummy_subsamples, 10)
